## Introduction
The ability to see is a profound gift, yet many visually impaired individuals face challenges in accessing written content. Braille, a widely used tactile reading and writing system, enables the visually impaired to learn effectively, but its adoption can be limited due to learning difficulties. The integration of IoT devices and deep learning has paved the way for innovative assistive technologies, such as a Smart Book Reader that converts Braille to speech. Deep learning, particularly Optical Braille Recognition(OBR) , excels in recognizing complex patterns and automating Braille script identification, offering accurate and user-friendly solutions. This transformative fusion enhances accessibility and empowers visually impaired individuals with new tools for learning and engagement.
